# Notes
We can generate our codes and times to link to specific
pieces and questions for the video resources

&start=allows us to change the start time

// Automagically build bookmarks with slack
// when files are slacked out, and associate those
// with activities

// We need to record activity and build an event out of it

# TODO
Introduce tests
